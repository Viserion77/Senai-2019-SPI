# 1. Define pi as a int or integer variable
pi = int(math.pi)

# 2. Define pie as a string
pie = ""

# 3. Define a variable called sentence that contains the string "I love to eat"
sentence = "I love to eat"

# 4. Use string concatenation to connect your variable sentence and pie (Make sure there's a space between eat and pie!)
# ? what ?

# 5. Define a variable called sentence2 that contains the string "The value of pi is: "
sentence2 = "The value of pi is: "

# 6. Use string concatenation to connect your variable sentence2 and pi (Hint: you can't connect an integer variable and a string variable! Try using str(pi) to turn pi into a string! Play around with the str() function to see what you can turn into a string and how you can use string concatenation to turn the integer - or float - into a sentence)

# Solution to 6:
# 
# pi = 3.14 ........
# 
# sentence2 = "The value of pi is: " ....
# 
print(sentence2 + str(pi))
