Here are some exercises to try:



1. Make a list of numbers from 1-10.

2. Print the last element of the list.

3. Print a list of numbers from 1-5 using the list you created in step 1.

4. Print a list of numbers from 6-10 using the list you created in step 1.

5. Print the odd numbers from 1-10 using the list you created in step 1.

6. Print the even numbers from 1-10 using the list you created in step 1.



Solution:

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(nums[-1])
print(nums[:5]) #remember index starts from 0 and remember that it will generate a list up to, but not including the index.
print(nums[5:])
print(nums[::2])
print(nums[1::2])
