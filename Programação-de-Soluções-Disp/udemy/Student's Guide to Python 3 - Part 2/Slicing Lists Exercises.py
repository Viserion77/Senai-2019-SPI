# Here are some exercises to try:

# 1. Make a list of numbers from 1-10.
list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# 2. Print the last element of the list.
print(list[-1])

# 3. Print a list of numbers from 1-5 using the list you created in step 1.
print(list[:5])

# 4. Print a list of numbers from 6-10 using the list you created in step 1.
print(list[5:])

# 5. Print the odd numbers from 1-10 using the list you created in step 1.
print(list[::2])

# 6. Print the even numbers from 1-10 using the list you created in step 1.
print(list[1::2])

# Solution:

# nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# print(nums[-1])
# print(nums[:5]) #remember index starts from 0 and remember that it will generate a list up to, but not including the index.
# print(nums[5:])
# print(nums[::2])
# print(nums[1::2])
