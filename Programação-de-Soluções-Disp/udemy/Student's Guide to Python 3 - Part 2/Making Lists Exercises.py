# Here are some exercises to try:

# 1. Make a list of 5 foods.
list = ['one food','one food 2','one food 3','one food 4','one food 4']

# 2. Make a function that returns the first food in the list.
def fisrtFood(foods):
     return foods[0]

# 3. Call the function and print the result.
print(fisrtFood(list))

# 4. What food is at index 4? Think about it and then print the item at index 4 of the list.
print(list[4])

# 5. Print the last element of the list. (Hint: You don't have to know what the size of the list is)
print(list[-1])

# Solution:

# foods = ["strawberry", "tomato", "turnip", "burger", "jelly"]
#  
# def firstfood():
#      return foods[0]
#  
# print(firstfood())
# #jelly is at index 4
# print(foods[4])
# #remember that lists begin at index 0!
# print(foods[-1])
