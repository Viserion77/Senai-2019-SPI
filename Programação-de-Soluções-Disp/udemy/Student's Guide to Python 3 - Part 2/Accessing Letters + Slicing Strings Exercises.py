# Here are some exercises to try:

# 1. Set a variable equal to the sentence: "I like birds."
variable="I like birds."

# 2. Try printing the period in the sentence.
print(variable[-1])

# 3. Try printing the letter 'l' in the sentence.
print(variable[0])

# 4. Print each word using slicing strings.
print(variable[0], variable[2:6], variable[7:12])

# 5. Print the sentence without the period.
print(variable[:12])

# 6. Someone has encrypted a message in the string "Ifdlasoasvqwesupjhysdtvfhsmoasn". The key is to get every third letter. Print the decoded message.
code = "Ifdlasoasvqwesupjhysdtvfhsmoasn"
print(code[::3])

# Solution:

# sentence = "I like birds."
# print(sentence[-1])
# print(sentence[0])
# print(sentence[0], sentence[2:6], sentence[7:12])
# print(sentence[:12])
# code = "Ifdlasoasvqwesupjhysdtvfhsmoasn"
# print(code[::3])
