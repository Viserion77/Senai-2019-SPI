# Here are some exercises to try:

# 1. We will be working with the same class throughout this unit, so make sure to hold on to your code!


# 2. Make a class Circle. Make sure to capitalize the class name, as classes are typically written in CamelCase.
class Circle():
    pass

# 3. Initialize the class with a variable circle1.
circle1 = Circle()

# 4. Try printing the type() function on the circle1. Is the type of the variable Circle?
print(type(circle1))

# 5. Initialize a second Circle called circle2.
circle2 = Circle()

# 6. If you got everything correct, you can delete circle1 and circle2 and the call to type().


# Solution:

# class Circle():
#   pass
#  
# circle1 = Circle()
# print(type(circle1))
# circle2 = Circle()
